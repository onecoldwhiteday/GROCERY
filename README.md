# GROCERY ðŸ¥¦
>A super-simple pwa to add and delete shopping list items in human readable format

I cannot use apple notes or reminders because they do not let you change the font size separately, 
which is RIDICULOUS and anti-accessible.\
All I need is freaking larger font-size to see clearly and quick check my list on the move in a grocery store. 
This is it. No icloud, no http calls, no bullshit.

- [ ] Drop React<sup>**</sup> in favour of vanilla js/html(or keep, just to spare some time)
- [ ] Readable list with removable items with two states "Added" / "In the cart"(strikethrough mb)
- [ ] Local Storage to keep it some time<sup>***</sup>
- [ ] FONT SIZE knob with step 1 pixel from 8 to 64px(approx)
  



<sup>*</sup> I might prefer to use paper, but its easier to forget it home while a smartphone is always at hand.

<sup>**</sup> It's made now from the basic pwa-template bc it provide those workers files

<sup>***</sup> I don't need to keep it sync or forever long - grocery shopping list lives/accumulates 3 days max, and I will most likely survive even if I lost it
